PLAN: Activity 15 GitHub Practice

1. First I will make the repository and make sure README is turned on so that it follows the directions and I can give people who view my repository some background information.
2. I will create two issues, and add a description for each of them, as well as the relevant labels.
3. I will create a new branch to meet the assignment's requirements.
4. I will then add the files (qmd and pdf) to the branch as well as this PLAN.md file and commit it to the branch. During this I will close the issues that I created.
5. Then, I will create a pull request, set the base to main, and the compare branch to the one i just made. I will say something like "merging activity 14 files". Create pull request afterwards.
6. Merge the pull request
7. Confirm that the issues are closed and that all files are in the main branch.
8. Submit
